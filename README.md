Breakout Rooms Summary:
- Talked about what overriding will do: takes element from the add and checks if it is null, and if it is throw an exception
- Clarified what T is supposed to represent and where to use it
- Talked about iterating through the Array and probably using compareTo to sort the Arrays
- Discussed what each of the two constructors are supposed to do : default is supposed to create one without any size, startingCapacity creates an empty one with a set size
